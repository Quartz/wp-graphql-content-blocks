						// another post), attachments (images uploaded in BlockControls),
						// terms ... really anything that the plugin user would want to
						// implement as a pointer from a block to another WP object.
						//
						// The really bad spot we're in here is that we have no idea how
						// to resolve these connections on the plugin user's behalf.
						// This is especially apparent for Gutenberg blocks: we're
						// looking for pointers in the block's attributes, but there is
						// no common convention or structure for encoding, say, a post
						// ID or an attachment ID. It's an implementation detail that,
						// likely, everyone will tackle differently. This is the same
						// problem we've had with post meta for years and years. Bummer,
						// because Gutenberg was an opportunity to provide structure for
						// this super-common use case.
						//
						// The only thing we can do is to provide an empty array and
						// leave it up to the implementor to filter the blocks (via
						// graphql_blocks_output) and make the connections themselves.
						// They will get the blocks and the post to which it belongs and
						// can sift through the attributes to determine if anything
						// needs to be connected.
						//
						// The MenuItemObjectUnion contains every GraphQL type that
						// we're interested in, so we'll use that. This tells me that we
						// should probably rename it upstream since it's useful for more
						// than just menu items (it's really a union of all core WP data
						// typesâ€”post types, taxonomies, users).
